<Person1> "Welcome to PODCASTIFY  - Your Personal Generative AI Podcast. Today, we're diving into the impressive credentials and work of Dr. Tharsis Souza! This guy's a powerhouse in the world of computer science and large language models." 
</Person1><Person2> "I've heard whispers.  Ph.D. from UCL, right?  University of London? That's a big deal!  What's he been up to that's got everyone buzzing, though?" 
</Person2><Person1> "Well, first off, he's literally writing the book...or rather a book, a big one at that. 'Large Language Models - The Hard Parts: Open Source AI Solutions for Common Pitfalls.'  O’Reilly. Need I say more?"
</Person1><Person2> "O’Reilly, wow.  Okay, so he's tackling the tough stuff.  Not just the basics, but the real-world challenges with LLMs.  Color me intrigued.  Any details on what kind of 'hard parts' he's dissecting?" 
</Person2><Person1> "I'm sure it's chock-full of insights on everything from bias to deployment, and given the open-source angle, probably practical solutions people can actually use.  This isn't just theory, folks!"
</Person1><Person2> "Practical solutions, you say?  So, someone like me, knee-deep in LLM projects, could actually get something actionable out of this book?  Music to my ears!"
</Person2><Person1> "Absolutely.  But wait, there's more! Dr. Souza isn't just hiding behind a keyboard. He's been featured in some pretty high-profile spots. Two Sigma, for one." 
</Person1><Person2> "Two Sigma?  That quantitative hedge fund giant? That's a serious endorsement of his expertise! What was he doing there?" 
</Person2><Person1> "Mentorship Spotlight!   Sharing his knowledge, guiding others, impacting the next generation of AI specialists.  Pretty impressive, right?" 
</Person1><Person2> "Incredibly. Okay, I'm sold. This guy's the real deal.  What else? Spill the tea!" 
</Person2><Person1> "He was also on a panel at the FactSet Investment Process Symposium, discussing innovative data. And get this, an interview with BattleFin Alternative Data. That's like, uh, the alternative data Olympics!"
</Person1><Person2> " The alternative data Olympics! I love it! So, he's comfortable talking the talk and walking the walk. Not just an academic, but a true practitioner in the field.  Okay, Dr. Souza, you have my attention." 
</Person2><Person1> "Right? It's clear he's not just keeping up with the AI revolution, he's actively shaping it. This book, the interviews, the talks, the mentorship – it's a testament to his deep understanding of the field and his passion for sharing that knowledge." 
</Person1><Person2> "Couldn't agree more.  I'm definitely adding that book to my reading list.  Thanks for the intel!"
</Person2><Person1> "My pleasure! Thanks for listening, and goodbye from PODCASTIFY!" </Person1>
